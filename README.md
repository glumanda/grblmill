# grblmill

I have derived this work from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:44854

You need the MCAD library https://github.com/SolidCode/MCAD

This design is

* fully printable 
* completly designed with openSCAD
* using alu profiles from http://www.kinetikmsystem.de/
** K30 for the basic construction
** K20 for the t-nut plate
* the T8 threaded rod and the TR8 nut i have sourced from http://www.metallbau-pietrzak.de/ (ebay)

Screws
* to connect the end parts to the profiles i have used M6 self cutting screws
* to fix the slider and the TR8 nut i used M3 screws
* fixing the t-nut prof√≠les use M4 screws

CNC-Control-Unit and Spindle
* i am using an Arduino Uno with Grbl V0.9g and a GrblShield with DRV8825 driver chips
* the spindle is from ebay (China) with a Driver Board, that can be connected to the Grbl-Board
