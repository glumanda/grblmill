##grbl_mill

* fully printable 
  * large parts are printed with a 0.8 mm nozzle
  * smaller parts with a 0.4 mm nozzle
* completly designed with openSCAD
* derived from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:44854
* you need the MCAD library https://github.com/SolidCode/MCAD

####Usage

* open grbl_mill_main.scad in openSCAD to view the assembled mill
  * you can select the viewed part in the main file by commenting out the appropriate line
* in grbl_mill_const.scad you can adjust the main construction
  * in the division Configuration you can configure the width (count) of profiles for each direction separatly
  * there are some more flags to configuring the mill
* some tuning is done directly in grbl_mill_parts.scad
* all things are downloadable

####Working Area

* xy: 107.5 mm x 84.3 mm
* z = about 40 - 50 mm, depending from tool and using the t-nut profiles
* is enough for milling pcbs or hobbed bolts

####Profiles
* using alu profiles from http://www.kinetikmsystem.de
* K30 for the basic construction
  * you can use for all directions a width of 3 basic profiles (like in the original design)
  * but i had some sourcing restrictions so i am used on y 4 basic profile width and for the other two profiles
  * length for z: 200 mm (movable) and 300 mm (fix)
  * length for x and y: 260 mm
* K20 for the t-nut plate
  * length is the same like for x: 260 mm

####Screws and Rods

* to connect the end parts to the profiles i have used M6 self cutting screws
* to fix the slider and the TR8 nut i used M3 screws
* fixing the t-nut prof√≠les use M4 screws

* the T8 threaded rod and the TR8 nut i have sourced from http://www.metallbau-pietrzak.de (ebay)
* the trapezoid rods are 300 mm (x), 250 mm (y) and 200 m (z) long
* the motor coupler on all axes is from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:173335

####CNC-Control-Unit and Spindle

* Arduino Uno with Grbl V0.9j https://github.com/grbl/grbl
* GrblShield with DRV8825 driver chips
* the spindle is from ebay (China) with a Driver Board, that can be connected to the Grbl-Board
